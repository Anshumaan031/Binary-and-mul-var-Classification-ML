Binary classification is the task of classifying the elements of a set into two groups on the basis of a classification rule.

Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample. The procedure has a single parameter called k that refers to the number of groups that a given data sample is to be split into.



There are 3 Naive Bayes classifiers 

Gaussian: It is used in classification and it assumes that features follow a normal distribution.

Multinomial: It is used for discrete counts. For example, let’s say,  we have a text classification problem. Here we can consider Bernoulli trials which is one step further and instead of “word occurring in the document”, we have “count how often word occurs in the document”, you can think of it as “number of times outcome number x_i is observed over the n trials”.

Bernoulli: The binomial model is useful if your feature vectors are binary (i.e. zeros and ones). One application would be text classification with ‘bag of words’ model where the 1s & 0s are “word occurs in the document” and “word does not occur in the document” respectively.
